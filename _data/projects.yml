     As soon as Natasha Lacy joined the New York Liberty on 2014, an action shot was needed to feature her in the videos at MSG. Since Lacy did not had an official photoshoot at that time, I was asked to make a composition of an action shot of her over another player.
     In here I show simple Photoshop basics, but hey, that action shoot was perfect for the promo that came later!
